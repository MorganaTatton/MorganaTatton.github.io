Welcome to the Morgana Tatton political styles quiz! This is a bit of fun, but hopefully
can also be used to describe real political distinctions. The left/right compass has its 
known deficiencies, and even adding and authoritarian/libertarian axis leaves a lot unstated.

For that reason, I created this Five Dimensional Political Styles Quiz. The axes are:

Freedom/conformity

Systematic/egoistic

Broad/particular

Hierarchy/equality

Fearful/stoic

Explanations (link here)

Otherwise, continue on!
