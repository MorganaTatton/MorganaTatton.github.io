What do each of these mean?

Freedom/conformity

This is essentially the same as the libertarian/authoritarian axis you 
might have seen in other political compasses. Those who value freedom
higher prioritise letting people do what they want in a wider range of 
circumstances. 

Examples of the politics of freedom include legalised homosexuality and
legalised hard drugs.

Higher levels of conformity mean a person believes moral norms 
should be enforced in more cases through law or regulation.

Examples of the politics of conformity include headscarf laws and attempts 
to ban adults from receiving trans medical care.
