Visionary/particular

Visionary politics is bold—some may say brash—and has a clear sense of what it wants to achieve. 
The goal and the "big picture" is prioritised.

Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump are visionary politicians. They each have a clear, simple story
about what is wrong and what they want to do. Medicare for all! Close the border!

Particular politics is the opposite of visionary politics. It is focused on details and individual
issues rather than a bigger narrative. Advocates call it nuanced. Detractors call it defensive or vague.

Keir Starmer is the archetypal particular politician. He is clear—some say "forensic"—on the details 
while critics say he lacks a simple story of what he wants to do in politics. Theresa May is a modest 
politician on the Conservative side.
