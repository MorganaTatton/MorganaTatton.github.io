Hierarchy/equality

This is the traditional left-right split. The more someone falls on the hierarchy end of the
spectrum, the more they believe that inequality is natural or desirable.

Examples of hierarchical politics include Thatcherism and fascism.

The more someone believes in equality, the more they value equality of opportunity and outcome. 

Examples of equality politics include New Deal Democrats and communism.
