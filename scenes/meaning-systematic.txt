Systematic/Egoistic

A systematic political order is one in which everyone is subject to equal rules, 
fairly applied. These rules aim to reduce bias and force or incentivise political 
actors to act in a more fair or just way, however that is defined. Believers in
systematic politics want their own side to be constrained by these rules as much
as their opponents. Systematic politics may also be described as institutional.

Examples of systematic politics include the general ideal of the rule of law, 
groups that oppose lobbying, and people who are especially interested in voting systems.

Egoistic politics is the opposite. An egoist believes that politics is better when the
rulers are unconstrained. Egoists see rules as barriers to effective action. 
Egoism is specifically about what rules limit the believers' own side. An egoist politician 
like Vladimir Putin will happily use enforcement to limit the freedom of his enemies and subjects.

Examples of egoistic politics include Donald Trump claiming he can declassify documents
by thinking about them, Boris Johnson breaking laws he introduced, and Juan Per√≥n shutting 
down opposition papers.
