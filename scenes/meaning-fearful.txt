Fearful/stoic

The stoic/fearful axis is about temperament. Do you feel depths of fear, anxiety, depression 
or despair about politics? Do you believe that we are in crisis? If so you fall on the fearful side 
of this axis. Fearful politics can be left or right wing. The scary thing could be climate change 
or terrorism or anything else. 

Fearful politics includes Donald Trump's "we need a total shutdown of the United States until we can
figure out what is going on", or those who believe that climate change will end all human life soon, 
or anyone who is just *really horribly worried*.

A stoic person may believe that we are in crisis but have worked out a way to minimise the emotional
effect of the crisis on them. Or they may naturally not be particularly concerned about danger. Or they may
believe that we are not currently in crisis.

Barack Obama and David Cameron are stoic politicians. They were basically optimistic about humanity 
throughout their time in office.
